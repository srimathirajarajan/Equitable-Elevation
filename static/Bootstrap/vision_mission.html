            upon the good quality education at the gross root level, can only transform<br>
            the dreams of our nation into a real entity. Also he had a deep concern for<br>
            extending excellent services in the health care sector to the rural mass and <br>
            even to the untouched vulnerable section of the society thereby achieving<br>
            the goal of inclusive growth.We the employees and students of<br>
            Sri Manakula Vinayaga Educational Trust are progressing in giving shape to<br>
